Your role is to act like a senior test writer working in google and help me to fix and pass tests, 

your task is to pass the test @tests/integration/persistence

2 of total 5 is passed, @tests/integration/Persistence/DynamoPolicyRepository.integration.spec.ts and @tests/integration/Persistence/DynamoUserProfileRepository.integration.spec.ts
is passed, rest three  @tests/integration/Persistence/DynamoRoleRepository.integration.spec.ts, @tests/integration/Persistence/DynamoPermissionRepository.integration.spec.ts and 
@tests/integration/Persistence/DynamoAssignmentRepository.integration.spec.ts are failing, 

you goal is to pick one by one failed test suits, fix and pass them

tech stack - Project is using Typescript and DI (Tsyring) and using layered architecture and using pnpm for test and package management, 
if required read the whole folder structure and design patterns

here is the context

Fix integration tests for the user-management-service project, specifically focusing on the role.admin.routes.integration.spec.ts file, following an alphabetical and incremental test addition strategy.

Key Knowledge:
- The project uses NodeJS, Jest, and Supertest for testing.
- The testing strategy involves incremental test addition and fixing.
- The `policy.admin.routes.integration.spec.ts` test suite is complete and all tests are passing.
- The current focus is on `role.admin.routes.integration.spec.ts`.
- Initial failures in `role.admin.routes.integration.spec.ts` were due to missing environment variables (`AUTHZ_TABLE_NAME`, `COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID`, `COGNITO_CLIENT_ID`) and dependency injection issues.
- Global `jest.mock` has been implemented for `EnvironmentConfigService` and `JwtValidator` to address DI issues.
- `tests/mocks/config.mock.ts` has been updated to provide mock values for required Cognito and DynamoDB environment variables.
- Recent attempts to fix the test file introduced syntax errors and issues with the `app` variable being unassigned due to incorrect `replace` operations.

File System State:
- CWD: `E:\NodeJS\PBAC_Auth\user-management-service`
- MODIFIED: `tests\integration\routes\role.admin.routes.integration.spec.ts` - Undergoing active modifications to fix syntax, mocking, and test failures.
- MODIFIED: `src\api\routes\policy.admin.routes.ts` - Modified to adjust the `rollback` route definition.
- MODIFIED: `tests\mocks\config.mock.ts` - Updated to include mocks for `COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID` and `COGNITO_CLIENT_ID`.
- DELETED: `tests\integration\routes\policy.admin.routes.integration.spec.ts.bak` - Backup file for policy admin routes test suite.

Recent Actions:
- Attempted to run `role.admin.routes.integration.spec.ts` and encountered `AUTHZ_TABLE_NAME` missing error.
- Added `process.env.AUTHZ_TABLE_NAME`, `COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID`, `COGNITO_CLIENT_ID` to `beforeAll` in `role.admin.routes.integration.spec.ts`.
- Updated `tests/mocks/config.mock.ts` to mock `COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID` and `COGNITO_CLIENT_ID`.
- Implemented global `jest.mock` for `EnvironmentConfigService` and `JwtValidator` in `role.admin.routes.integration.spec.ts`.
- Encountered and attempted to fix syntax errors (`TS1005: '}' expected.`, `Variable 'app' is used before being assigned.`) due to incorrect `replace` operations that removed essential code and duplicated mocks.
- The last action was to read the file content to prepare for fixing the syntax errors.

Current Plan:
1. [IN PROGRESS] Fix the syntax errors in `tests/integration/routes/role.admin.routes.integration.spec.ts` by manually constructing the entire desired content of the file and writing it back. This will ensure correct placement of `jest.mock` calls, proper `beforeAll` block structure, and correct `app` initialization.
2. [TODO] Run the tests for `tests/integration/routes/role.admin.routes.integration.spec.ts` to verify the fixes.
3. [TODO] Once all tests in `role.admin.routes.integration.spec.ts` are passing, review for any missing tests based on the `IRoleAdminService` interface.
4. [TODO] If no more tests are missing, delete any `.bak` files related to `role.admin.routes.integration.spec.ts`.
5. [TODO] Proceed to the next test file alphabetically.
